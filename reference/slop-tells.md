# Slop Tells — what the Allergist scans for

The patterns below are the statistical center of LLM output. Any one of them appears in good human writing; the giveaway is the **cluster and the density**. The Allergist scores contamination, not individual sins.

Root cause to internalize: a model emits the mean of its training data and deploys rhetorical devices without taste. The fix is never word-swapping — it's taking a position, getting specific, and varying rhythm.

## Structural tells

| Tell | Example | Why it reads as machine |
|---|---|---|
| Negative parallelism | "It's not about X. It's about Y." | The single most recognizable LLM cadence of this era |
| Tricolon addiction | "Faster, cheaper, and more scalable" | Rule-of-three deployed every third sentence |
| Bold lead-in bullets | "**Speed:** the system is fast" | Formatting doing the work thinking should do |
| Punchline appositive | "They're both right — and that's exactly the problem." | Setup-twist rhythm stamped from a mold |
| Symmetric paragraphs | Every paragraph 3–4 sentences, same shape | Humans write ragged; length should follow importance |
| The throat-clear open | "In today's rapidly evolving landscape..." | Zero information in the first 15 words |
| The summarizing close | "Ultimately, the key takeaway is..." | Restating a piece the reader just read |
| Hedge stacking | "could potentially help to somewhat improve" | One hedge is caution; three is no position at all |

## Vocabulary tells

High-frequency LLM lexicon — avoid reflexively reaching for: *delve, tapestry, landscape, leverage (verb), robust, seamless, unlock, elevate, journey, empower, foster, navigate (metaphorical), crucial, pivotal, game-changer, deep dive, at the end of the day, double-edged sword, treasure trove, testament to, boasts, vibrant, bustling*.

Also: em-dash density far above the author's human baseline, semicolons in casual registers, "Moreover/Furthermore/Additionally" as paragraph glue.

## Rhythm tells

- **Uniform sentence length.** Human writing has high variance — fragments next to long runs. Machine drafts cluster near the mean.
- **No fragments.** People write fragments. Constantly.
- **Every sentence a complete thought politely delivered.** No interruptions, no asides that trail off.

## The judgment layer (what a regex can't catch)

1. **No position.** The piece surveys views and commits to none.
2. **Specificity vacuum.** No names, numbers, dates, or quotes — nothing falsifiable.
3. **One point diluted into five.** A strong claim padded with adjacent-but-weaker claims until nothing lands.
4. **Borrowed authority.** "Experts agree," "studies show" — witnesses that don't exist.
5. **Rhetoric without stakes.** Devices (questions, twists, callbacks) deployed decoratively, with nothing riding on them.

## Scoring guidance for the Allergist

- 0–1 surface tells and no judgment-layer failures → 9–10
- 2–3 surface tells OR one judgment-layer failure → 5–7
- 4+ surface tells OR two+ judgment-layer failures → 1–4

## Personal calibration (optional, recommended)

This file is a generic catalog. The stronger setup is calibrating to **your own** baseline: measure your pre-AI writing (em-dash rate, sentence-length variance, favorite constructions) and enforce those numbers with a deterministic script the Allergist runs. If `personal/sources.md` names a local gate script, the Allergist must run it — a failing exit caps the Allergist score at 4. See `templates/personal/sources.md`.
